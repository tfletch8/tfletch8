## About Me
Hi there! My name is Thomas Fletcher, and I am a senior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte studying computer science with a concentration in software, systems, and networks. I have some projects I am currently working on at the moment, but I have also created a golf course website that utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrated a weather API.

## Projects
I have also created a golf course website that utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrated a weather API.
I am currently working on a College Football Team Ranker, which ranks any college football team by conference, and I will potentially integrate an Angular frontend with the current Java backend.

## Goals and Objectives
I aspire to become a software engineer one day for any company.
