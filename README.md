## About Me
Hi there! My name is Thomas Fletcher, and I am a recent Computer Science graduate of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a concentration in software, systems, and networks. I have some projects I am currently working on at the moment, but I have created a golf course website that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrates a weather API, as well as a grocery store website that was a capstone project I worked on with some of my former colleagues.
